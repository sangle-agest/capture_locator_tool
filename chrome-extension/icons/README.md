# Icon Placeholders

Since I cannot generate actual icon files, please create PNG icons with the following specifications:

## Required Icons:
- **icon16.png** - 16x16 pixels
- **icon32.png** - 32x32 pixels  
- **icon48.png** - 48x48 pixels
- **icon128.png** - 128x128 pixels

## Design Suggestions:
- Use the ðŸŽ¯ target emoji as inspiration
- Colors: Blue (#007acc) background with white target symbol
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Consider using a crosshair or locator pin design

## Tools to Create Icons:
- **Online**: Canva, Figma, or similar design tools
- **Software**: Photoshop, GIMP, or Sketch
- **AI**: Ask ChatGPT with DALL-E to generate icons
- **Free Resources**: Icons8, Flaticon, or similar icon libraries

## Temporary Solution:
You can use any target/crosshair PNG icons for now and replace them later.

The extension will work without custom icons (Chrome will use default), but custom icons make it look more professional.
